# Music Slayer

Team Music Slayers have created an application for users to access their favorite music. It not only allows them to browse for music but also let them search their preferred songs preview using Artists or Albums.

It has a unique feature to display lyrics of selected songs and also top 10 music playlist of preferred artists so that users can view their favorite songs.

Users will have access to view a graph representing the artist’s information about the highest number of listeners from different cities around the world. This is what makes this application unique and attract more users.
